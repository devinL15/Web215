        Model a person with attributes firstname and lastName and
        a function to print the full name.

        Model a menuItem to hold taco and burrito costs and food order that
        holds the number of tacos and burritos ordered and performs the
        following functions:
        1. calculate the extended taco price
        2. calculate the extended burrito price
        3. calc the subtotal
        4. calc the tax amount
        5. calc the grand total
