    Use the following instructions:

    1. Write a method that will populate the array and store it in the session storage.
    2. Write a method to find an object by id in storage and increment its quantity by 1.
    3. Write a method to find an object by id in storage and decrement its quantity by 1.
    4. Write a method that displays the contents of the array in the browser. Allow the user
